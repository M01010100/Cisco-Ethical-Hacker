# MODULE 3 Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning

## Reconnaissance

**Gathering of information about the enemy** 

- Active Reconnaissance 
    - tools "Probe" the targets 
    - elicit response from targets, this contains a variety of information
    - May crash smaller devices such as printers
    - Methods:
        - Host enumeration, Network enumeration, User enumeration, Group enumeration, Network share enumeration, Web page enumeration, Application enumeration, Service enumeration, Packet crafting

- Passive Reconnaissance
    - tools do not directly interact with targets
    - from third party databases, litening to traffic and analyzing it to deduce intelligence
    - not likely to be detected or noticed as in active. 
    - Methods: 
        - Domain enumeration, Packet inspection, OSINT, Recon-ng, Eavesdropping

**Lab - Using OSINT**
