# Intro to Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing

# 1.1

**Why** 
-  despite deploying security process and models, it is not enough to have blind faith. 
- The threat you plan for is not the one that comes. 
- Lab - job search (Did not save HTML - will for future labs).

**Threat Actors**
- Organized Crime:
    - Ransomeware, datatheft, what ever is popular and highly monetized. 
- Hacktivists 
    - Idealists using hacking to promote their cause
- State-Sponsered 
    - Cyber war and espionage
    - theft of information, and embedding into infrastructure
- Insider Threat 
    - Can be a normal employee compromised by attack
    - Could be malicious, ourposfully leaking or leaving holes

**Enviromental considerations**

- Network Tests 
    - Security posture
    - Consists of:
        - Switches, Routers, Firewalls, authentication,authorization, and accounting(AAA) servers and IPS
- Application
    - weakness in enterprise applications 
    - misconfigurations, input validations, inject issues, and logic flaws
    - can inculde database for most web applications
    - Open Web Application Security Project
- Cloud 
    - AWS: Shared Responsibility Model
    - depends on type (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) 

- Bug Bounties
    - enables hacker to gain recognition and money legally
    - turn in bugs and bounties to Corporations or Gov

**Methodologies**

- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)
    - adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedure (TTPs)
    - used by both offensive sec and incident response
    - includes OSINT
    

- [OWASP WSTG](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
    - OWASP Web Security Testing Guide
    - provides attack vectors for testing such as XSS, XML external entity (XXE), Cross-site request Forgery (CSRF).

- [NIST SP 800-115](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-115/final)
    - guideline for planning and conducting information security testing
    - **Industry Standard for Penetration Testing guidance**

- [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/)
    - Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
    - Operational Security Metrics, Trust Analysis, Work Flow, Human Security Testing, Physical Security Testing, Wireless Security Testing, Telecommunications Security Testing, Data Networks Security Testing, Compliance Regulations, Reporting with the Security Test Audit Report (STAR)

- [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/)
    - Penetration Testing Execution Standard
    - Pre-engagement interactions, Intelligence gathering, Threat modeling, Vulnerability analysis, Exploitation, Post-exploitation, Reporting

- ISSAF
    - Information System Security Assessment Framework
    - Information gathering, Network mapping, Vulnerability identification, Penetration, Gaining access and privilege escalation, Enumerating further,  Compromising remote users/sites, Maintaining access, Covering the tracks
